# Project Todos

A singel application page build with Redux-toolkit.
User able to add tasks, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not.

## The problem

Understanding the logic between Reducers and Componets take me for a while. What the role of reducer, create a Slice, and then how can i transfer the store and    actions to components was a bit challening for me. 
Immutability was another challenge part for me.
